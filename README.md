Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The run_analysis.R script does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set (contained in files X_train.txt and X_test.txt; these files must be in the same directory of the run_analysis.R script)
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Descriptive activity names are added to name the activities in the data set (files y_train.txt, y_test.txt, and activity_labels.txt must be in the same directory of the run_analysis.R script)
4. Labels are added to describe variables. 
5. From the data set in step 4, a file named average.txt is created, containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (files subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt must be in the same directory of the run_analysis.R script).
